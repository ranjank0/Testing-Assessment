1. Carefully read the requirement docs shared to us
2. We perform requirement analysis for the following:- a. Complete   b. Unamniguou(Clear)s   c. Prioritize       d. Identifiable   e. Traceable

  and apfter performing these 5 steps, we are finding that the requirement for the Name-textbox is incomplete. so we assume the minimum for the name textbox.
 
  We also found the description for the login pasword textbox, description the given to user is giving the more than one meaning.

3. We identified the below black box test design method:
 1. DT
 2. EP
 3. BVA

4. We also edentified the nessecity of test case optimization technique like orthogonal and pairwise and here, we have used the pairwise technique to optizise the test cases.
